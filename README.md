‚ú® Key Features
üì® Automated Email Ingestion: Automatically fetches all support-related emails from a Gmail account over the last 24 hours, searching for keywords like "Support," "Query," and "Help" in the entire message.

ü§ñ Intelligent AI Analysis:

Priority Detection: A rule-based system instantly flags emails containing keywords like "Urgent" or "Critical" for immediate attention.

Sentiment Analysis: Utilizes a distilbert-base-uncased model from Hugging Face to classify each email's tone as Positive, Negative, or Neutral.

‚úçÔ∏è Context-Aware Response Generation:

Employs the Google Gemini API (gemini-1.5-flash-latest) to generate high-quality, empathetic, and professional draft replies.

Features a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) pipeline, using a local knowledge base (kb.txt) to find relevant information and provide factually accurate answers.

üìä Interactive Analytics Dashboard:

Provides at-a-glance statistics with cards for Total Emails, Pending, Resolved, and Urgent.

Includes a suite of charts to visualize Status Overview, Priority Breakdown, and Sentiment Distribution over time.

üîÑ Full End-to-End Workflow: Allows users to seamlessly review, edit, and send AI-generated replies directly from the dashboard, automatically marking the email as "Resolved".

üèõÔ∏è Architecture & How It Works
The application operates on a decoupled client-server architecture, ensuring a scalable and maintainable system.

Frontend (Client): A single-page application built with HTML, Tailwind CSS, and Chart.js. It provides a clean and responsive user interface that communicates with the backend via REST API calls to fetch data and trigger actions.

Backend (API Server): A robust FastAPI server acts as the central brain. It exposes endpoints for fetching emails, generating responses, sending replies, and retrieving analytics data.

Email Ingestion Pipeline:

A background task is initiated via an API call.

It securely connects to the Gmail API using OAuth 2.0 credentials.

It performs a comprehensive search for relevant emails and loops through all pages of results to ensure no email is missed.

Each unique email is parsed, cleaned, and stored in the SQLite database.

AI Processing Core:

Initial Analysis: As soon as an email is stored, it's passed through local AI models for priority and sentiment analysis.

RAG Pipeline for Response Generation:

The user selects an email, triggering a request to the /generate-response endpoint.

The email body is converted into a numerical vector (embedding) using a SentenceTransformer model.

Faiss (Facebook AI Similarity Search) is used to perform an ultra-fast search against a pre-indexed vector knowledge base, retrieving the most relevant Q&A pairs.

This retrieved context is combined with the original email and its sentiment into a carefully engineered prompt.

The final prompt is sent to the Google Gemini API, which returns a coherent, context-aware, and helpful draft reply.

Database: A simple and efficient SQLite database stores all email data, including metadata, AI analysis results, and status (pending/resolved).
